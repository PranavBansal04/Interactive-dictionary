# Interactive-dictionary
A very basic web page that displays the definition of words by clicking on them.
I wanted to keep it simple and just wanted to show the use and implementation of capturing mouse events.
Thats why stored data is used here. There are only 4 words on the webpage, a section for their definition.
The background color of the word changes when cursor comes over it and goes away.
